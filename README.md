Hi there, I'm Jack Germain! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a freelance software engineer and full-stack web developer passionate about crafting modern, adaptable websites. My focus has been on building web solutions for restaurants, startups, and small businesses, but I'm always looking to expand into other industries.

ðŸ’» What I Do:

Web Design & Development â€“ I create responsive, user-friendly websites tailored to businesses that want to grow their online presence.
Freelancing â€“ I work closely with clients, helping them establish their digital footprint with sleek, professional websites.
Community Engagement â€“ Iâ€™ve offered website services to local charities to help them gain visibility and attract more donations.

ðŸ“Œ Why Work With Me?

I understand small businessesâ€”I'm one myself! I respect the hard work that goes into running one, and I build websites that reflect that dedication.
My approach is simple: clean design, smooth functionality, and a hassle-free process.
I ensure transparency with clients by discussing the project in detail before proposing solutions and running them through a clear, easy-to-understand contract.
